# Master

This is the master module of the iotinator framework.


It runs on esp8266 hardware, connected to a SIM800 chip and an Oled screen, and offers an interface to slave modules in order to monitor them through SMS and webApps.

It connects to a domestic Wifi network and exposes a "private" Wifi network to communicate with slave modules.

Configuration is persisted in EEPROM.
